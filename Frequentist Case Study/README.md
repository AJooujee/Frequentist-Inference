This repository hosts a case study on frequentist inference, which is part of the Springboard Data Science curriculum. The exercise draws from 'The Art of Statistics' by David Spiegelhalter. In the Part-B notebook, we explore a real-time dataset concerning a hospital administrator who is worried that the average charges to patients may have dropped below a specific threshold. Additionally, the administrator is interested in determining if the charges to patients are influenced by whether they have made an insurance claim.
